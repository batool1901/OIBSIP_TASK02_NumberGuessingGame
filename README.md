# OIBSIP_TASK02_NumberGuessingGame

In this fun Java project, I created a "Guess the Number" game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user is asked to guess the number through a dialogue box, and the game provides hints if the guess is too high or too low. I added features like limited attempts, multiple rounds, and a scoring system that awards points based on the number of attempts taken to guess correctly.
